# Linear_control_systems_24677
This repository contains the controller files for Linear Control Systems project (24677) taken in Fall 2019.  

This project aims to design a controller for your Buggy (autonomous) team. This project is sub-divided into 4 assignments:

## P1
- a) Linearize the state space model.
  b) Design a PID Lateral and PID Longitudinal controller.
  
## P2 
- a) Check controllability and stabilizability of linearized model.
  b) Pole Placement.
  
## P3
- a) Design an optimal controller for vehicle.
  
## P4
- a) Design a Kalman Filter to filter disturbances in the states.
  b) Race with other Buggy teams in class.
